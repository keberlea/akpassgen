# AK Password Generator

#### Description


Password generators are handy in creating more unqie and safer passcodes. This is benefial to a large group of users as most individuals want their information stored safely on pages they use. This project helped solved the issue of creating unique user passwords by the individual self and allows users to answer a few questions to in turn get a very unique password which they can then use or store for future use.

I learned how to combine different javascript syntax in order to create a website that generates a random passowrd from 8 to 128 characters. This taught me how to create new arrays and display them, how to push variables to a new array, how to create prompts and store user inputs to futher use them, and I figured out how to use while conditional loops which I believe worked very well with this assignment.
